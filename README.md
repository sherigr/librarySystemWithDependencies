In AccountingJS Part 6, we wrote a ```librarySystem``` function for loading libraries. With that function, you could do stuff like this:
```
librarySystem('app', function() {
  return 'app';
});

console.log(librarySystem('app')); // 'app'
```
But we'd like the ability for libraries created with librarySystem to depend on each other. For example, we'd like to be able to do the following:
```
librarySystem('dependency', [], function() {
  return 'loaded dependency';
});

librarySystem('app', ['dependency'], function(dependency) {
  return 'app with ' + dependency;
});

librarySystem('app'); // 'app with loaded dependency'
```
In this example, we have two libraries, 'dependency' and 'app'. The twist here is that 'app' needs the 'dependency' library to work. That's why ```librarySystem``` here also takes an array that lists required dependencies.

In the example above, we only specify one dependency, but ```librarySystem``` should be flexible enough to accept any number (0 or more).

Below is an example of a library that needs two dependencies.
```
librarySystem('name', [], function() {
  return 'Gordon';
});

librarySystem('company', [], function() {
  return 'Watch and Code';
});

librarySystem('workBlurb', ['name', 'company'], function(name, company) {
  return name + ' works at ' + company;
});

librarySystem('workBlurb'); // 'Gordon works at Watch and Code'
```
The task is to rewrite librarySystem so it accepts dependencies as described above.
